%% Cultural Harmony Learning Algorithm - Created in 18 Jan 2022 by Seyed Muhammad Hossein Mousavi
% Here is all about learning with evolutionary algorithms. Harmony search
% and cultural algorithms are two fast optimization algorithms which their
% result are combined here in order to train inputs for targets in a simple
% dataset. Basically, system starts with making initial fuzzy model and fit
% the outputs based on inputs by harmony search first and then tries to fit the
% harmony search outputs with inputs in the second stage. That means we are using both
% evolutionary algorithms to improve the accuracy. System easily could be
% used for regression, classification and other optimization tasks. You can
% use your data and play with parameters.
